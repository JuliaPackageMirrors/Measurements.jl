Examples
--------

These are some basic examples of use of the package:

.. code-block:: julia

    using Measurements
    a = measurement(4.5, 0.1)
    # => 4.5 ± 0.1
    b = 3.8 ± 0.4
    # => 3.8 ± 0.4
    2a + b
    # => 12.8 ± 0.4472135954999579
    a - 1.2b
    # => -0.05999999999999961 ± 0.49030602688525043
    l = measurement(0.936, 1e-3);
    T = 1.942 ± 4e-3;
    g = 4pi^2*l/T^2
    # => 9.797993213510699 ± 0.041697817535336676
    c = measurement(4)
    # => 4.0 ± 0.0
    a*c
    # => 18.0 ± 0.4
    sind(94 ± 1.2)
    # => 0.9975640502598242 ± 0.0014609761696991563
    x = 5.48 ± 0.67;
    y = 9.36 ± 1.02;
    log(2x^2 - 3.4y)
    # =>  3.3406260917568824 ± 0.5344198747546611
    atan2(y, x)
    # => 1.0411291003154137 ± 0.07141014208254456

Correlation Between Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you can see examples of how functionally correlated variables are treated
within the package:

.. code-block:: julia

    x = 8.4 ± 0.7
    x - x
    # => 0.0 ± 0.0
    x/x
    # => 1.0 ± 0.0
    x*x*x - x^3
    # => 0.0 ± 0.0
    sin(x)/cos(x) - tan(x)
    # => -2.220446049250313e-16 ± 0.0
    # They are equal within numerical accuracy
    y = -5.9 ± 0.2
    beta(x, y) - gamma(x)*gamma(y)/gamma(x + y)
    # => 0.0 ± 3.979039320256561e-14

You will get similar results for a variable that is a function of an already
existing ``Measurement`` object:

.. code-block:: julia

    u = 2x
    (x + x) - u
    # => 0.0 ± 0.0
    u/2x
    # => 1.0 ± 0.0
    u^3 - 8x^3
    # => 0.0 ± 0.0
    cos(x)^2 - (1 + cos(u))/2
    # => 0.0 ± 0.0

A variable that has the same nominal value and uncertainty as ``u`` above but is
not functionally correlated with ``x`` will give different outcomes:

.. code-block:: julia

    # Define a new measurement but with same nominal value
    # and uncertainty as u, so v is not correlated with x
    v = 16.8 ± 1.4
    (x + x) - v
    # => 0.0 ± 1.979898987322333
    v/2x
    # => 1.0 ± 0.11785113019775792
    v^3 - 8x^3
    # => 0.0 ± 1676.4200705455657
    cos(x)^2 - (1 + cos(v))/2
    # => 0.0 ± 0.8786465354843539

``@uncertain`` Macro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Macro ``@uncertain`` can be used to propagate uncertainty in arbitrary real or
complex functions of real arguments, including functions not natively supported
by this package.

.. code-block:: julia

    @uncertain (x -> complex(zeta(x), exp(eta(x)^2)))(2 ± 0.13)
    # => (1.6449340668482273 ± 0.12188127308075564) + (1.9668868646839253 ± 0.042613944993428333)im
    @uncertain log(9.4 ± 1.3, 58.8 ± 3.7)
    # => 1.8182372640255153 ± 0.11568300475873611
    log(9.4 ± 1.3, 58.8 ± 3.7)
    # => 1.8182372640255153 ± 0.11568300475593848

You usually do not need to define a wrapping function before using it.  In the
case where you have to define a function, like in the first line of previous
examples, `anonymous functions
<http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/functions/#anonymous-functions>`__
allow you to do it in a very concise way.

The macro works with functions calling C/Fortran functions as well.  For
example, `Cuba.jl <https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl>`__ package performs
numerical integration by wrapping the C `Cuba <http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/>`__
library.  You can define a function to numerically compute with ``Cuba.jl`` the
integral defining the `error function
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function>`__ and pass it to ``@uncertain``
macro.  Compare the result with that of the ``erf`` function, natively supported
in ``Measurements.jl`` package

.. code-block:: julia

    using Cuba
    cubaerf(x::Real) =
        2x/sqrt(pi)*Cuhre((t, f) -> f[1] = exp(-abs2(t[1]*x)), 1, 1)[1][1]
    @uncertain cubaerf(0.5 ± 0.01)
    # => 0.5204998778130466 ± 0.008787825789336267
    erf(0.5 ± 0.01)
    # => 0.5204998778130465 ± 0.008787825789354449

Also here you can use an anonymous function instead of defining the ``cubaerf``
function, do it as an exercise.

.. Tip::

   Note that the argument of ``@uncertain`` macro must be a function call whose
   arguments are ``Measurement`` objects.  Thus,

   .. code-block:: julia

      @uncertain zeta(13.4 ± 0.8) + eta(8.51 ± 0.67)

   will not work because here the outermost function is ``+``, whose arguments
   are ``zeta(13.4 ± 0.8)`` and ``eta(8.51 ± 0.67)``, that however cannot be
   calculated.  Once more, wrap this expression in an (anonymous) function:

   .. code-block:: julia

      @uncertain ((x, y) -> zeta(x) + eta(y))(13.4 ± 0.8, 8.51 ± 0.67)
      # => 1.9974303172187315 ± 0.0012169293212062773

   The type of *all* the arguments provided must be ``Measurement``.  If one of
   the arguments is actually an exact number (so without uncertainty), convert
   it to ``Measurement`` type:

   .. code-block:: julia

       atan2(10, 13.5 ± 0.8)
       # => 0.6375487981386927 ± 0.028343666961913202
       @uncertain atan2(10 ± 0, 13.5 ± 0.8)
       # => 0.6375487981386927 ± 0.028343666962347438

   In addition, the function must be differentiable in all its arguments.  For
   example, the scaled first derivative of the Airy Ai function
   :math:`\text{airyx}(1, z) = \exp((2/3) z \sqrt{z})\text{Ai}'(z)` is not
   differentiable in the first argument, not even the trick of passing an exact
   measurement would work because the first argument must be an integer.  You
   can easily work around this limitation by wrapping the function in a
   single-argument function

   .. code-block:: julia

       @uncertain (x -> airyx(1, x))(4.8 ± 0.2)
       # => -0.42300740589773583 ± 0.004083414330362105

Complex Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are a few examples about uncertainty propagation of complex-valued
measurements.

.. code-block:: julia

    u = complex(32.7 ± 1.1, -3.1 ± 0.2)
    v = complex(7.6 ± 0.9, 53.2 ± 3.4)
    2u+v
    # => (73.0 ± 2.3769728648009427) + (47.0 ± 3.4234485537247377)*im
    sqrt(u*v)
    # => (33.004702573592 ± 1.0831254428098636) + (25.997507418428984 ± 1.1082833691607152)*im
    gamma(u/v)
    # => (-0.25050193836584694 ± 0.011473098558745594) + (1.2079738483289788 ± 0.133606565257322)*im

You can also verify the `Euler’s formula
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula>`__

.. code-block:: julia

    cis(u)
    # => (6.27781144696534 ± 23.454542573739754) + (21.291738410228678 ± 8.112997844397572)*im
    cos(u) + sin(u)*im
    # => (6.277811446965339 ± 23.454542573739754) + (21.291738410228678 ± 8.112997844397572)im

Arbitrary Precision Calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you performed an exceptionally good experiment that gave you extremely
precise results (that is, with very low relative error), you may want to use
`arbitrary precision
<http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#arbitrary-precision-arithmetic>`__
(or multiple precision) calculations, in order not to loose significance of the
experimental results.  Luckily, Julia natively supports this type of arithmetic
and so ``Measurements.jl`` does.  You only have to create ``Measurement``
objects with nominal value and uncertainty of type ``BigFloat``.

.. Tip::

   As explained in the `Julia documentation
   <http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/numbers/#Base.BigFloat>`__, it is
   better to use the ``big`` string literal to initialize an arbitrary precision
   floating point constant, instead of the ``BigFloat`` and ``big`` functions.
   See examples below.

For example, you want to measure a quantity that is the product of two
observables :math:`a` and :math:`b`, and the expected value of the product is
:math:`12.00000007`.  You measure :math:`a = 3.00000001 \pm (1\times 10^{-17})`
and :math:`b = 4.00000001 \pm (1\times 10^{-17})` and want to compute the
standard score of the product with :func:`stdscore`.  Using the ability of
``Measurements.jl`` to perform arbitrary precision calculations you discover
that

.. code-block:: julia

   a = big"3.00000001" ± big"1e-17"
   b = big"4.00000001" ± big"1e-17"
   stdscore(a*b, 12.00000007)
   # => -7.25510901439718980095468884170649047384323406887854411581099003148365616351548

the measurement significantly differs from the expected value and you make a
great discovery.  Instead, if you used double precision accuracy, you would have
wrongly found that your measurement is consistent with the expected value:

.. code-block:: julia

   stdscore((3.00000001 ± 1e-17)*(4.00000001 ± 1e-17), 12.00000007)
   # => 0.0

and you would have missed an important prize due to the use of an incorrect
arithmetic.

Of course, you can perform any mathematical operation supported in
``Measurements.jl`` using arbitrary precision arithmetic:

.. code-block:: julia

    hypot(a, b)
    # => 5.000000014000000000399999998880000003119999991353600023834879934652928178154746 ± 9.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999967e-18
    log(2a)^b
    # => 1.030668110995484938037006520012324656386442805506891265153048683619922226691323e+01 ± 9.744450581349821315555305038012032439062183433587962363526314884889736017119502e-17

Arrays of Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create arrays of ``Measurement`` objects and perform mathematical
operations on them in the most natural way possible:

.. code-block:: julia

    A = [1.03 ± 0.14, 2.88 ± 0.35, 5.46 ± 0.97]
    B = [0.92 ± 0.11, 3.14 ± 0.42, 4.67 ± 0.58]
    exp.(sqrt.(B)) - log.(A)
    # => 3-element Array{Measurements.Measurement{Float64},1}:
    #     2.5799612193837493 ± 0.20215123893809778
    #     4.824843081566397 ± 0.7076631767039828
    #     6.982522998771525 ± 1.178287422979362
    cos.(A).^2 + sin.(A).^2
    # 3-element Array{Measurements.Measurement{Float64},1}:
    #     1.0 ± 0.0
    #     1.0 ± 0.0
    #     1.0 ± 0.0

If you originally have separate arrays of values and uncertainties, you can
create an array of ``Measurement`` objects by providing ``measurement`` with
those arrays (remember to use the `dot syntax
<http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/functions/#man-dot-vectorizing>`__
for vectorizing functions):

.. code-block:: julia

    C = measurement.([174.9, 253.8, 626.1], [12.2, 19.4, 38.5])
    # => 3-element Array{Measurements.Measurement{Float64},1}:
    #     174.9 ± 12.2
    #     253.8 ± 19.4
    #     626.1 ± 38.5
    sum(C)
    # => 1054.8000000000002 ± 44.80457565918909
    mean(C)
    # => 351.6000000000001 ± 14.93485855306303

Derivative and Gradient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to propagate the uncertainties, ``Measurements.jl`` keeps track of the
partial derivative of an expression with respect to all independent measurements
from which the expression comes. The package provides two convenient functions,
``Measurements.derivative`` and ``Measurements.gradient``, that return the
partial derivative and the gradient of an expression with respect to independent
measurements.

.. code-block:: julia

    x = 98.1 ± 12.7
    y = 105.4 ± 25.6
    z = 78.3 ± 14.1
    Measurements.derivative(2x - 4y, x)
    # => 2.0
    Measurements.derivative(2x - 4y, y)
    # => -4.0
    Measurements.gradient(2x - 4y, [x, y, z])
    # => 3-element Array{Float64,1}:
    #      2.0
    #     -4.0
    #      0.0  # The expression does not depend on z

.. Tip::

   The ``Measurements.gradient`` function is useful in order to discover which
   variable contributes most to the total uncertainty of a given expression, if
   you want to minimize it.  This can be calculated as the `Hadamard
   (element-wise) product
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_%28matrices%29>`__ between
   the gradient of the expression with respect to the set of variables and the
   vector of uncertainties of the same variables in the same order.  For
   example:

   .. code-block:: julia

       w = y^(3//4)*log(y) + 3x - cos(y/x)
       # => 447.0410543780643 ± 52.41813324207829
       (Measurements.gradient(w, [x, y]).*[a.err for a in (x,y)]).^2
       # => 2-element Array{Any,1}:
       #     1442.31
       #     1305.36

   In this case, the ``x`` variable contributes most to the uncertainty of
   ``w``.  In addition, note that the `Euclidean norm
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm>`__ of the Hadamard product
   above is exactly the total uncertainty of the expression:

   .. code-block:: julia

       vecnorm(Measurements.gradient(w, [x, y]).*[a.err for a in (x,y)])
       # => 52.41813324207829

``stdscore`` Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get the distance in number of standard deviations between a measurement
and its expected value (this can be with or without uncertainty) using
``stdscore``:

.. code-block:: julia

    stdscore(1.3 ± 0.12, 1)
    # => 2.5000000000000004
    stdscore(4.7 ± 0.58, 5 ± 0.01)
    # => -0.5172413793103445 ± 0.017241379310344827

``weightedmean`` Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate the weighted and arithmetic means of your set of measurements with
``weightedmean`` and ``mean`` respectively:

.. code-block:: julia

    weightedmean((3.1±0.32, 3.2±0.38, 3.5±0.61, 3.8±0.25))
    # => 3.4665384454054498 ± 0.16812474090663868
    mean((3.1±0.32, 3.2±0.38, 3.5±0.61, 3.8±0.25))
    # => 3.4000000000000004 ± 0.2063673908348894

``value`` and ``uncertainty`` Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``value`` and ``uncertainty`` to get the values and uncertainties of
measurements.  They work with real and complex measurements, scalars or arrays:

.. code-block:: julia

    value(94.5 ± 1.6)
    # => 94.5
    uncertainty(94.5 ± 1.6)
    # => 1.6
    value([complex(87.3 ± 2.9, 64.3 ± 3.0), complex(55.1 ± 2.8, -19.1 ± 4.6)])
    # => 2-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
    #     87.3+64.3im
    #     55.1-19.1im
    uncertainty([complex(87.3 ± 2.9, 64.3 ± 3.0), complex(55.1 ± 2.8, -19.1 ± 4.6)])
    # => 2-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
    #     2.9+3.0im
    #     2.8+4.6im

Use with ``SIUnits.jl`` and ``Unitful.jl``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``Measurements.jl`` in combination with a third-party package in
order to perform calculations involving physical measurements, i.e.  numbers
with uncertainty and physical unit.  The details depend on the specific package
adopted.  Such packages are, for instance, `SIUnits.jl
<https://github.com/Keno/SIUnits.jl>`__ and `Unitful.jl
<https://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl>`__.  You only have to use the
``Measurement`` object as the value of the ``SIQuantity`` object (for
``SIUnits.jl``) or of the ``Quantity`` object (for ``Unitful.jl``).  Here are a
few examples.

.. code-block:: julia

   using Measurements, SIUnits, SIUnits.ShortUnits
   hypot((3 ± 1)*m, (4 ± 2)*m) # Pythagorean theorem
   # => 5.0 ± 1.7088007490635064 m
   (50 ± 1)Ω * (13 ± 2.4)*1e-2*A # Ohm's Law

   using Measurements, Unitful
