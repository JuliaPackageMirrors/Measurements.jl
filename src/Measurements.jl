### Commentary:

# This file is the entry point of the package: it defines the new `Measurement'
# type, some functions to handle it within Julia and the new functions provided
# by the package and exposed to users.

### Code:

# Define the "Derivatives" type, used inside "Measurement" type.  This should be

##### New Type: Measurement
# Definition.  The Measurement type is composed by the following fields:
#   * val: the nominal value of the measurement
#   * err: the uncertainty, assumed to be standard deviation
#   * tag: a (hopefully) unique identifier, it is used to identify a specific
#     measurement in the list of derivatives.  This is usually created with
#     `rand'.
#   * der: the list of derivates.  It is a lightweight dictionary, whose keys
#     are the tuples (nominal value, uncertainty, tag) of all independent
#     variables from which the object has been derived, the corresponding value
#     is the partial derivative of the object with respect to that independent
#     variable.  This dictionary is useful to trace the contribution of each
#     measurement and propagate the uncertainty in the case of functions with
#     more than one argument (in order to deal with correlation between
#     arguments).

    val::T
    err::T
    tag::Float64
    der::Derivatives{Tuple{T, T, Float64}, T}
end

# The constructor that users are going to use.  As a Julia convention, the
# lowercase version of a type constructor does something more than the
# constructor itself.
